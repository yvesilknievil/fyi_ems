= EVTEC bidirectional Charging Station

Implementation of a EVTec bidirectional charging station. 

== Compatibility 
* EVTec bidirectional charging station

== Application Notes

There is no full integration of bidirectional charging stations. 
This driver behaves like an EVCS when charging a car and it behaves like a battery, when 
the car is discharged. 

=== Dependencies
=== Maturity
Production State: *-experimental-* 

Open Issues:
* no full bidirectional charging integration into OpenEMS.
