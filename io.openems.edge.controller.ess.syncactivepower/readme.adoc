= ESS Sync Active Power

Controller gets a reference to two energy storage systems ESS 0 and ESS 1.
It constantly reads ess0 and tries to reproduce the charge/discharge of ESS 0 with ESS 1. 
ESS 1 follows the behavior of ESS 0.

== UseCase

Offgrid system where ESS 0 is in control of the offgrid net and ESS 1 is added to enhance the capacity of ESS 0
